hmm. i seem to have lost all chat records in this project.
could you please summon the bmad project manager, and then scan the codebase again. especially all the \*.md docs, @bmad-docs/ documentation, the @bmad-docs/stories/ checklists, and of course the @CLAUDE.md and other relevant info, to see where we currently stand in development.
If i recall correctly, we have successfully deployed an early, satisfactory prototype with GitHub pages.
Although I have some gripes with it (which I will get into later)

hold on, before we deploy, there are more things id like to reconfigure.
First of all, the animations here seem a bit laggy.
Can you evaluate why that is?
Maybe there are elements that can be lazy loaded?
Maybe some elements use too high of resolution?
Maybe there are some unecessary elements that overcomplicate and resource intensive?
can you do an audit on that?
Then, on this element: <section class="relative bg-transparent z-10"> which is the section header for the project showcase,
I want the scroll behavior so that when the user scrolls through to that section, after the navbar appears and sticks to the top of the screen, i want the section header to initially stick to the bottom border of the navbar.
Currently, when I scroll through to the project showcase section, when the navbar appears and sticks to the top of the screen, the project showcase section header cannot be seen, as the top of the showcase body (<div class="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 pt-8 pb-20">) is the element that sticks to the top of the screen, and it also does not stick to the bottom of the navbar, but to the top border of the screen, making the top bit obscured by the navbar. Do you understand what I am meaning?
