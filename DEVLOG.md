- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Organized imports logically
- Removed duplicate code and unused variables

#### 5. Accessibility
- Added proper ARIA labels to interactive elements
- Ensured sufficient color contrast
- Made interactive elements keyboard-navigable
- Added proper heading hierarchy

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies Used
- `framer-motion`: For animations and gestures
- `react-type-animation`: For the typewriter effect
- `react-icons`: For social media and UI icons
- `tailwindcss`: For styling and theming

#### Key Code Snippets

```jsx
// Animation variants for framer-motion
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
      delayChildren: 0.3,
    },
  },
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  show: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type: 'spring',
      stiffness: 100,
      damping: 15,
    },
  },
};
```

### Next Steps

1. **Component Refinements**
   - Fine-tune animation timings and easing
   - Optimize performance for mobile devices
   - Add more interactive elements

2. **Testing**
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Performance profiling
   - Accessibility audit

3. **Documentation**
   - Add Storybook stories
   - Create usage guidelines
   - Document component props and theming options

### Notes
- The current implementation follows the cyberpunk/neon theme as specified in the design requirements.
- All animations are implemented with performance in mind, using hardware acceleration where possible.
- The component is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
