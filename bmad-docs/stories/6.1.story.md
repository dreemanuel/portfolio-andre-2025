# Story 6.1: Performance Optimization & SEO Enhancement

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a potential employer/client discovering Andre Emanuel's portfolio website
- I want the site to load quickly, rank well in search results, and provide an excellent user experience
- so that I can efficiently evaluate Andre's work and the site demonstrates his technical competency through its own performance

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Performance Benchmarks (NFR-1)**: The website shall achieve Google Lighthouse scores of >90 for Performance, >95 for Accessibility, >90 for Best Practices, and >90 for SEO.

2. **SEO Optimization**: The site shall be optimized for search engines with proper meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML, and relevant keywords for "full-stack developer" and "web developer portfolio" searches.

3. **Image Optimization**: All images shall be optimized with modern formats (WebP), responsive sizing, and lazy loading to minimize load times and bandwidth usage.

4. **Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization**: The application shall implement code splitting and bundle optimization to reduce initial load times and improve perceived performance.

5. **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper caching headers and strategies for static assets to improve repeat visit performance.

6. **Analytics Integration**: Add Google Analytics or similar tracking to monitor user behavior, page performance, and conversion metrics for the contact form.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Technical Requirements:
- **Performance Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- **Bundle Analyzer**: webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar for Vite
- **Image Optimization**: Sharp, ImageOptim, or Vite image optimization plugins
- **SEO Tools**: React Helmet for meta tags, structured data generators
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4, Plausible, or similar privacy-focused solution

### Performance Targets:
```
Lighthouse Score Targets:
- Performance: >90 (target: 95+)
- Accessibility: >95 (target: 98+)
- Best Practices: >90 (target: 95+)
- SEO: >90 (target: 95+)

Core Web Vitals:
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): <2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): <100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): <0.1
```

### SEO Implementation:
```javascript
// Meta tags structure
const seoData = {
  title: "Andre Emanuel - Full-Stack Developer & Creative Problem Solver",
  description: "Experienced full-stack developer specializing in React, Node.js, and modern web technologies. Available for freelance projects and full-time opportunities.",
  keywords: "full-stack developer, web developer, React developer, Node.js, JavaScript, portfolio",
  author: "Andre Emanuel",
  ogImage: "/images/andre-emanuel-og-image.jpg",
  canonicalUrl: "https://andremanuel.dev"
};
```

### Image Optimization Strategy:
```javascript
// Responsive image implementation
<picture>
  <source srcSet="/images/hero-mobile.webp" media="(max-width: 768px)" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcSet="/images/hero-tablet.webp" media="(max-width: 1024px)" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcSet="/images/hero-desktop.webp" media="(min-width: 1025px)" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="/images/hero-fallback.jpg" alt="Andre Emanuel - Full-Stack Developer" loading="lazy" />
</picture>
```

### Code Splitting Strategy:
- **Route-based splitting**: Separate bundles for Home, About, Contact, Projects
- **Component-based splitting**: Lazy load ProjectDetailsModal, ContactForm
- **Vendor splitting**: Separate bundle for large dependencies (Framer Motion, etc.)
- **CSS splitting**: Component-specific CSS loading

### Bundle Optimization:
- **Vite Configuration**: Enable build optimizations and tree shaking
- **Dependency Analysis**: Remove unused dependencies and replace heavy ones
- **Tailwind Purging**: Remove unused CSS classes from production build
- **Asset Optimization**: Enable compression and minification

### Analytics Configuration:
```javascript
// Google Analytics 4 setup
gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
  page_title: document.title,
  page_location: window.location.href,
  custom_map: {
    'custom_parameter': 'contact_form_submission'
  }
});
```

### Performance Monitoring:
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user performance metrics
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated performance testing
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor JavaScript errors and performance issues
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor contact form completion rates

### Deployment Optimizations:
- **CDN Integration**: Use Vercel Edge Network or Cloudflare
- **Compression**: Enable gzip/brotli compression
- **HTTP/2**: Ensure HTTP/2 support for multiplexing
- **Caching Headers**: Set appropriate cache lifetimes for different asset types
