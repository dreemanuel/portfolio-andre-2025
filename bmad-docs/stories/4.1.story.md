# Story 4.1: Project Showcase System Implementation

## Status: InProgress

## Story

- As a visitor to Andre Emanuel's portfolio website
- I want to view and interact with a comprehensive showcase of Andre's past projects
- so that I can evaluate his technical skills, design capabilities, and professional experience through visual examples and detailed project information

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Visual Project Gallery (US-2.1, FR-2.1, FR-2.2)**: The Project Showcase section shall display projects as interactive tiles, each showing a screenshot of the website, arranged in a visually appealing grid layout.

2. **Interactive Hover Effects (US-2.2, FR-2.3)**: On hover, project tiles shall expand with bezier curve animations and display glassmorphism effect backgrounds, along with descriptive text (date of completion, technologies used, industry sector).

3. **Detailed Project Modal (US-2.3, FR-2.4)**: On click, project tiles shall trigger a pop-up dialog displaying a gallery of screenshots for that project, detailed description, and a "Visit website" button linking to the live project.

4. **Project Data Integration**: The showcase shall utilize and enhance the existing `src/data/projects.js` data structure with additional fields for comprehensive project information.

5. **Responsive Design Excellence**: The project showcase shall be fully responsive with optimal layouts for desktop (3-4 columns), tablet (2 columns), and mobile (1 column) with touch-friendly interactions.

6. **Performance Optimization**: The showcase shall implement lazy loading for images, optimized animations, and efficient rendering to maintain smooth performance with multiple projects.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Technical Requirements:
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable ProjectTile and ProjectDetailsModal components
- **Animation Framework**: Framer Motion for hover effects, modal transitions, and gallery animations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with cyberpunk theme (glassmorphism, neon accents)
- **Image Handling**: Optimized images with lazy loading and responsive formats
- **State Management**: Local component state for modal visibility and gallery navigation

### Project Data Structure Enhancement:
```javascript
// Enhanced src/data/projects.js structure
{
  id: 'project-1',
  title: 'Project Name',
  description: 'Brief project description',
  detailedDescription: 'Comprehensive project description with challenges, solutions, outcomes',
  heroImage: '/images/projects/project-1/hero.jpg',
  screenshots: [
    '/images/projects/project-1/screenshot-1.jpg',
    '/images/projects/project-1/screenshot-2.jpg'
  ],
  technologies: ['React', 'Node.js', 'MongoDB'],
  industry: 'E-commerce',
  completedDate: '2024-03',
  liveUrl: 'https://project-url.com',
  githubUrl: 'https://github.com/user/repo',
  features: ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2'],
  challenges: 'Technical challenges faced',
  outcomes: 'Project results and metrics'
}
```

### Design Specifications:
- **Tile Hover Effects**: Scale 1.05, shadow elevation, glassmorphism overlay
- **Modal Design**: Full-screen overlay with centered content, glassmorphism backdrop
- **Animation Timing**: 0.3s hover transitions, 0.4s modal entrance/exit
- **Grid Layout**: Gap-6 on desktop, gap-4 on mobile, responsive columns
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent neon cyan/green accents, dark cyberpunk theme

### Component Structure:
```
ProjectShowcase/
├── ProjectShowcase.jsx     # Main showcase container
├── ProjectTile.jsx         # Individual project tiles
├── ProjectDetailsModal.jsx # Modal for detailed project view
├── ImageGallery.jsx        # Gallery component for modal
└── LazyImage.jsx          # Optimized image component
```

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Intersection Observer**: For lazy loading images and animation triggers
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks, responsive sizing
- **Animation Performance**: Use transform and opacity for smooth 60fps animations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for modal component if needed

### Accessibility Requirements:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard access for tiles and modal
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Trap focus within modal, return focus on close
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for all text overlays
