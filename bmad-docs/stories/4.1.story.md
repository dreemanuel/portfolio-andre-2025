# Story 4.1: Project Showcase System Implementation

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a visitor to Andre Emanuel's portfolio website
- I want to view and interact with a comprehensive showcase of Andre's past projects
- so that I can evaluate his technical skills, design capabilities, and professional experience through visual examples and detailed project information

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Visual Project Gallery (US-2.1, FR-2.1, FR-2.2)**: The Project Showcase section shall display projects as interactive tiles, each showing a screenshot of the website, arranged in a visually appealing grid layout.

2. **Interactive Hover Effects (US-2.2, FR-2.3)**: On hover, project tiles shall expand with bezier curve animations and display glassmorphism effect backgrounds, along with descriptive text (date of completion, technologies used, industry sector).

3. **Detailed Project Modal (US-2.3, FR-2.4)**: On click, project tiles shall trigger a pop-up dialog displaying a gallery of screenshots for that project, detailed description, and a "Visit website" button linking to the live project.

4. **Project Data Integration**: The showcase shall utilize and enhance the existing `src/data/projects.js` data structure with additional fields for comprehensive project information.

5. **Responsive Design Excellence**: The project showcase shall be fully responsive with optimal layouts for desktop (3-4 columns), tablet (2 columns), and mobile (1 column) with touch-friendly interactions.

6. **Performance Optimization**: The showcase shall implement lazy loading for images, optimized animations, and efficient rendering to maintain smooth performance with multiple projects.
