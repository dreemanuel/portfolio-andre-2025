# Story 2.1: Contact Form & Lead Generation System

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a potential client/employer visiting Andre Emanuel's portfolio website
- I want to fill out a comprehensive contact form on a dedicated page
- so that I can easily send inquiries and Andre can capture my information for future outreach campaigns

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Dedicated Contact Form Page (FR-4.1, FR-4.2)**: The contact form shall be implemented on a separate `/contact` page with fields for name, email, subject, and message, featuring cyberpunk-styled form validation and user feedback.

2. **Backend Integration (FR-4.3)**: Form submissions shall be processed via Vercel Serverless Functions and stored in a Supabase database for lead management and future outreach campaigns.

3. **Form Validation & UX (NFR-3, NFR-4)**: The form shall include comprehensive client-side and server-side validation with clear error messages, loading states, and success confirmations following accessibility standards.

4. **Security Implementation (NFR-7)**: The contact form shall implement basic security measures including input validation, sanitization, and spam protection using free-tier solutions.

5. **Performance & Responsiveness (NFR-1, NFR-2)**: The contact page shall load quickly, be fully responsive across all devices, and maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic with glassmorphism effects.

6. **Integration with Navigation (US-4.1)**: The "Work with me" CTA buttons in HeroSection shall properly navigate to the contact form page with smooth page transitions.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Technical Requirements:
- **Frontend Framework**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with cyberpunk theme (Catppuccin Frappe palette)
- **Form Library**: React Hook Form for performance and validation
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (`/api/contact.js`)
- **Database**: Supabase with PostgreSQL
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for both client and server
- **Security**: Input sanitization, rate limiting, CORS configuration

### Database Schema (Supabase):
```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_submissions (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT
);
```

### API Endpoint Structure:
- **POST `/api/contact`**: Submit contact form
- **Request Body**: `{ name, email, subject, message }`
- **Response**: `{ success: boolean, message: string, id?: string }`
- **Error Codes**: 400 (validation), 429 (rate limit), 500 (server error)

### Design Specifications:
- **Form Container**: Glassmorphism with `bg-ctp-base/80` and `backdrop-blur-md`
- **Input Fields**: Neon border focus states with `border-neon-cyan`
- **Submit Button**: Gradient background from `neon-cyan` to `neon-green`
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for form field animations and feedback states
- **Typography**: Font hierarchy matching existing cyberpunk theme

### Integration Points:
- **ContactPage.jsx**: Replace with comprehensive form implementation
- **HeroSection.jsx**: Ensure "Work with me" buttons link to `/contact`
- **Navbar.jsx**: Contact link in navigation should highlight when active
- **App.jsx**: Verify routing configuration for contact page

### Environment Variables Required:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

### Security Considerations:
- Rate limiting: 5 submissions per IP per hour
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Email validation to prevent header injection
- CORS configuration for production domain
- Server-side validation matching client-side rules
