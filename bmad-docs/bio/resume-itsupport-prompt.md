# IT Support Resume - AI Prompt


Can you please act as an expert and experienced hiring manager and human resources manager who is also a career mentor specializing in helping entry-level jobseekers like me to find work in the IT industry and, in particular, assist in drafting for me the best possible CV/Resume that has the highest probability of getting accepted for an interview by a hiring manager of a tech company.

I will include the resume I have drafted, in which I have followed structural and content suggestions from resources I have found on the web, including a youtube channel named networkchuck and the website enhancv.com.

I will also include some tips as well as sample resumes from those resources which I have used to help me write mine. 

Can you please guide me in perfecting my draft and include the reasoning behind the decisions you made?

Keep in mind, too, that the resume needs to be ATS-friendly as it is the standard these days.

I will tell you a bit of background about myself which I may have not included in my resume draft, in the hope that additional context can help you in adding value to my resume:

I am a 39 year old father of 1, and my past professional experience has mostly been in the F&B industry. I also have a strong background in art, which has been one of my main strengths since childhood. 

Along with my pursuit of art, I also have a deeply curious mind for technology, both hardware and software, but due to financial restrictions have not been able to commit to pursuing those interests fully until I became an adult and was able to afford my own devices.

I have always been fascinated by computers and electronic devices, and have been tinkering with any kind of electronic hardware from electric guitars and audio systems to PCs and computer software.

After graduating from art school and initially finding work as a product designer and freelancing as a graphic designer, I was ultimately pushed by financial conditions to work in the food and beverage industry, which I came to love and eventually excelled at, rising to top level operations management overseeing multiple restaurant and bar branches in Bali, the tourism and hospitality capital of Indonesia.

I guess this may prove that I take what is put in front of me seriously, and with conviction, and that I have the ability to learn on the spot quickly and efficiently.

After my last position in F&B, I was blessed with a daughter, but that led me to deciding that a future in that industry was not viable, as it meant long hours of work in a high pressure environment, which could lead to a future of spending inadequate quality time with family. I ultimately took the decision to work freelance while caring for my baby, and explains a long career gap in my resume. 

As a freelancer, I took jobs as a graphic designer, product designer, and virtual assistant, while also (unsuccessfully) trying to land jobs in copywriting, web development, and UI/UX design. In this period I also took an interest and learned web development, including programming languages like Python and Javascript, and web dev libraries like React, SASS, Bootstrap, etc, as well as a deep interest in AI. I have acquired certificates from freeCodeCamp.org in Responsive Web Design and Fullstack Development. But trying to find a job where I could exercise these skills proved to be very difficult, especially in these times where I see that this field has become somewhat oversaturated and highly competitive, exacerbated also by the rise of AI and AI agents which have replaced the need for many jobs that previously required junior software engineers or web developers.

Seeing this development, I have become interested in other fields in tech where I can put my acquired skills to use, which I have extensively researched and found to not be as in danger/decline, such as cyber security, networking, or cloud computing.

I have then started my learning path, taking courses from the Google Certification program for Cybersecurity and IT Support, and I realized that there seems to be some overlap with the skills and interests I have acquired over my experiences.

I have also researched that the quickest path to land positions in the IT field is to find an IT Support/helpdesk job as soon as possible, which brings us to the present time, where I am today, trying to apply for my first IT Support job. 


Here is my resume draft, based on the resources and lessons I have collected so far:
