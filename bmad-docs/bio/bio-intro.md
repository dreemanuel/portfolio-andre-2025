Greetings everyone, my name is Andre Emanuel and I live in Bali, Indonesia.  
    
My career background is in F&B Operations, where I have managed multiple locations both in Jakarta and Bali.  
    
The life of an F&B operator is busy, hard, time consuming, and often feels like you’re spinning a bunch of plates on sticks, albeit I must admit it was very fulfilling work. But this, coupled with my daughter being born (she’s 5 now), persuaded me to take a sharp pivot and try to find work that can allow me to balance time between family and finances better.  
    
I am a jack of all trades. Besides my background in F&B operations (which include skills in operations management, admin, bookkeeping, food costing, menu concepting, restaurant planning, recruiting, purchasing, etc), I am an art school graduate and have experience in graphic design, product design, illustration, and 3D design.  
    
I also have freelancing experience copywriting, doing voice overs, and also translation (Indonesian - English).  
    
I have a habit of geeking out into my many interests, which include art, languages, music, sports and fitness, history, philosophy, technology (I am currently in awe and infinitely inspired by advancements in all things AI) and, of course, culinary arts.  
    
I’ve been really happy to get in touch with all of you in this community, which is honestly such a daily mood booster. I can’t wait to graduate from this course and work with you all, getting swamped by clients and overwhelmed with work.  
But, like I always say, “Let's make it happen!.”  
    
Let’s make it happen.

    I am an expert in web development, software development, graphic design, web and UI/UX design, product design, and illustration. Having graduated in fine arts and visual design from university, I have spent 14 years honing those skills in my career both as a freelancer and in various big-name national companies.
    
      
    
    I am a creative thinker at heart, and am addicted to applying my creativity to find solutions to problems. This has led me to being a jack of all trades that likes to geek out in many interests including art, music, languages, sport and fitness, history, philoshophy, and technology (I am currently in awe and infinitely inspired by advancements in all things AI).
