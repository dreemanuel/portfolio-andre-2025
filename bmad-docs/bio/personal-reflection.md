I am an open minded, critically thinking, creative individual, whose curiosity knows no bounds. I am highly motivated by seeking creative solutions for problems, and I’ll try anything new once or twice. When I am interested in something I go in hard and I dig deep. I tend to view issues from many perspectives but I also try to be as objective as possible, often playing the role of the devil’s advocate when a discussion is veering towards a certain narrative. That aside, I tend to see the humor in all things, and also the bright side in times of stress. I am also a fast learner and enjoy helping others, and my work experience has made me pressure resistant and resourceful in solving problems fast.  
  

Cheesy as it may sound, I think my biggest weakness is my perfectionism. Let me explain. My obsessive perfectionism bleeds through other aspects in my life. For example, when I don’t think I have given the best output for a certain task, I may get discouraged, put it off, or even quit–and then move on to something new (manifests into time management, consistency, and priority issues). I am fixing this. My personality test shows that I am 53% extraverted, but I think of myself more as an introvert and I do have a limited social battery that gets drained fast. Although I don’t think introvertedness is generally a weakness, it often hinders me from making personal connections that would otherwise have been beneficial.
