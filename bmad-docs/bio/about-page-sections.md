## Section 3: Career Journey
### Title: "From Restaurant Floors to Code Repositories"

**The F&B Years (2008-2017):**
Led teams of 25+ staff across multiple high-volume restaurant locations in Bali's tourism hub. Managed everything from daily operations to system implementations, helping expand Smokehouse Texas BBQ from 1 to 3 locations in just one year.

**The Transition (2017-Present):**
Becoming a father changed my priorities. I needed work that offered both creative fulfillment and family time. Technology wasn't new to me—I'd always been the guy tinkering with computers, building home labs, and solving technical problems. The transition was really a homecoming.

**Key Achievements:**
- Established Bali's first authentic Texas BBQ restaurant
- Managed multi-location operations with 500+ daily orders
- Self-taught developer with multiple certifications
- Built complex home networking and server infrastructure

## Section 4: Personal Interests
### Title: "Beyond the Code"

**Technology Enthusiast:**
I run a home lab with various servers, constantly experimenting with new tools and configurations. Currently pursuing Google certifications in IT Support and Cybersecurity because learning never stops.

**Creative Arts:**
Fine arts background that influences everything I build. Whether it's the user interface of an app or the aesthetic of a physical space, I believe good design makes technology more human.

**Music & Making:**
Multi-instrumentalist with a home studio setup. There's something about creating music that parallels coding—both require patience, precision, and the willingness to iterate until it feels right.

**Languages & Culture:**
Native English and Indonesian speaker, currently learning Spanish. Growing up between cultures taught me that the best solutions often come from diverse perspectives.

## Section 5: Work Philosophy
### Title: "How I Approach Problems"

**Creative + Technical Mindset:**
My unique combination of artistic training and technical skills means I don't just build solutions that work—I build solutions that delight users. Every project gets both the left-brain logic and right-brain creativity it deserves.

**Pressure-Tested Problem Solving:**
Restaurant management taught me to think quickly under pressure, stay resourceful when resources are limited, and maintain composure when everything seems to be happening at once. These skills translate perfectly to debugging complex applications at 2 AM.

**Continuous Learning:**
Whether it's mastering a new JavaScript framework or perfecting BBQ brisket technique, I believe in going deep. When something captures my interest, I don't just learn it—I obsess over it until I understand it from every angle.

## Section 6: Personal Touch
### Title: "Life in Bali"

**Family First:**
Everything I do is motivated by my brilliant 5-year-old daughter. My career pivot wasn't just professional—it was personal. I wanted to build a future where I could be present for the moments that matter while doing work that energizes rather than drains.

**Island Life, Global Work:**
Bali offers the perfect blend of inspiration and tranquility. I can troubleshoot network configurations in the morning and surf at sunset. This balance keeps me creative, focused, and grateful for the work I get to do.

**Fun Facts:**
- Built my entire Linux desktop environment using only AI assistance
- Can equally troubleshoot React components and BBQ smokers
- Believe the best debugging sessions happen with good coffee and even better music
- Always have at least three side projects running (currently: home automation, language learning app, and perfecting my brisket recipe)
